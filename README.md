This project investigates the relationship between a Worker's Age and Earnings--with respect to variables such as Sex and Education status. Data have been compiled for the year of 2008 (from a March 2009 survey) from Handbook of Labor Statistics published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics website. These data will examine full-time workers described by the documentation provided as "employed more than 35 hours per week for at least 48 weeks in the previous year" (see CPS08 Documentation).

Data analysed with R language and environment
